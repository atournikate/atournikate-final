This is my 'master' project, which essentially is intended to summarize what I have learned in the last 8 months at Opportunity.

Retrospective:
-I feel like I ran out of time, and I am disappointed by that.
-However, I am proud that I took on the task of learning and utilizing a program with which I was previously not experienced.
-My choice to use React was due to the desire to acquaint myself with the program; job opportunities that I have an interest in applying to call for experience with React, and I wanted to get a head start.

GOOD
-I was very proud when I had breakthroughs on certain logics. It is very satisfying when I make something work the way I think it's supposed to work.
-I am especially proud of the Tab4 (Details) photos and their functionality.

BAD
-To get to those breakthroughs, there was a lot of incredibly intense noodling, and I could feel strong tension within myself.

UGLY
-Due to the fact that I felt like I was behind on the project (wegen die Praktikum), I did not adequately utilize Trello during the project.
-I feel that the project is incomplete and falls short of my vision, and I know that there are things I need to fix/edit/redesign.
